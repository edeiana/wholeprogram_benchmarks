  Run 
  - "make compile" for all  benchmarks 

  This will 
	  - Builds all the NAS benchmarks that do not encounter a compilation error

STEP 3) Save the single bitcode files 
    Run "make bitcode" to setup run directories and extract bitcodes.

    This will do the following:
    1)Setup run directories for specified workload of all benchmarks at 'BenchmarksBitcodes/build/NAS/benchmarks/'
    2)Extract single bitcode files for all built benchmarks at respective run directories.
